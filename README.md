# BrickBreaker
 Brick Breaker mirrors the timeless arcade hit Breakout, tasking players with demolishing a wall of bricks by rebounding a bouncing ball with a paddle. Progressing to increasingly challenging levels occurs once all bricks are eradicated. Initially, players are granted 3 lives, forfeiting one each time the ball contacts the screen's bottom. Exhausting all lives results in game over.
